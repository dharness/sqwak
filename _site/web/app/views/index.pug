      |Sqwak is a friendly neural net that is learning to 
      |tell sounds apart.
    p
      b Mission: 
      |Help teach Sqwak which sounds are similar, and 
      |which ones arenâ€™t.
    p
      b Instructions: 
      |Listen to the original sound. Then 
      |listen to attempts to copy the sound. Rate the attempt 
      b(style='color:#FF5D55;') high if it sounds similar, low if it does not.
    p
      b Rule of thumb: 
      |If you can tell they were trying to make 
      |the original sound, 
      b(style='color:#42CCF8;') give them a rating of at least five.
